## Week 1: Program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI) called bmi.py
    I used the reference:
        > https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36048713/3-arguments-calculating-bmi-python

The calculation was in feet, inches and pounds so I re wrote the code in my own way and with cm, m and kg

## Week 2: program that takes asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order called secondstring.py
    I used the reference:
        >https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25375794/how-to-reverse-the-order-of-letters-in-a-string-in-python
This code only reversed the code so I changed the 1 to a 2 so that it would only print every second letter
